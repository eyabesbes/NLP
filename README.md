## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a conversational chatbot designed specifically for Arabic speakers. The chatbot utilizes the power of transformer models, such as BERT or GPT, to understand and generate responses in Arabic, ensuring natural and meaningful interactions.

## Features
- **Transformer-based architecture**: Leverages state-of-the-art models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Arabic language support**: Tailored specifically for Arabic, including support for dialects and complex sentence structures.
- **Engaging conversations**: Designed to provide human-like and contextually relevant responses.
